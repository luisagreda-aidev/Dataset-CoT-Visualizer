## Future Integrations

The Chain-of-Thought Dataset Visualizer is designed to be a versatile tool for researchers and developers, and we have several exciting integrations and enhancements planned for future releases. Here are some of the key features and capabilities we aim to incorporate:

### 1. Advanced Analytics and Visualization

- **Data Insights**: Implement advanced analytics to provide insights into dataset statistics, such as the distribution of question types, average length of reasoning processes, and response accuracy metrics.
- **Visualization Tools**: Integrate visualization tools to graphically represent data trends, patterns, and relationships within the datasets, aiding in better understanding and analysis.

### 2. Enhanced Editing and Collaboration Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Enable real-time collaboration features, allowing multiple users to work on the same dataset simultaneously, with changes reflected instantly across all sessions.
- **Version Control**: Implement version control for datasets, enabling users to track changes, revert to previous versions, and manage updates efficiently.

### 3. Machine Learning Model Integration

- **Model Training Interface**: Provide an interface for training machine learning models directly within the application, utilizing the loaded datasets for fine-tuning and evaluation.
- **Model Evaluation Tools**: Incorporate tools for evaluating model performance, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to help users assess the effectiveness of their models.

### 4. Expanded Dataset Support

- **Multi-Format Support**: Extend support to additional dataset formats beyond JSON, such as CSV, XML, and custom formats, to accommodate a wider range of data sources.
- **Automated Dataset Enrichment**: Implement features for automated dataset enrichment, such as adding missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and enhancing data quality through automated processes.

### 5. User Experience Enhancements

- **Customizable Dashboards**: Allow users to create customizable dashboards to monitor key metrics and visualizations tailored to their specific needs.
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Develop interactive tutorials and guides to help new users get started with the application and understand its features more effectively.

### 6. Integration with External Tools and Services
